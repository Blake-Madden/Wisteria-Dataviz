# Pages {#page-properties}

A page can contain the following properties:

- `"name"`: A string value representing the name of the page.
- `"page-numbering"`: Resets the internal page counter to 1. \
  Note that the page number can be referenced via the function ``PageNumber()``.
- `"watermark"`: A watermark to add to each page. \
  Note that this will override the report's watermark section for this page. \
  Available options are:
  - `"label"`: String to write across the pages.
  - `"color"`: The watermark's color. \
    This can be either a color name or hex-encoded value.
- `"background-color"`: The page's background color (name or hex value).
- `"background-image"`: A string specifying the path to an image to use as the page's background.
- `"rows"`: The definitions of rows of content in the report. \
  This is where all embedded graphs, labels, images, etc. on the page are defined.
  Each row can contain items such as graphs, labels, and images.
