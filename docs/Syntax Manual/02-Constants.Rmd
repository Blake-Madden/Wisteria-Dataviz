# (PART) Data & Constants {-}

# Constants {#constants-properties}

Properties for the `"constants"` node:

- `"constants"`: contains an array of key and value pairs, which are referenced by other items in the project.<br />
  Items reference key/value pairs via text labels using a special syntax. For example, `label` objects or graph
  titles can embed a reference to a runtime value, which will be expanded when the report is rendered.
  - `"name"`: the key used for the item. Other items reference this using the syntax `{{name}}`, where `name` is the look-up key.
  - `"value"` either a string or numeric value to associate with the key.<br />
    If a number, then it will be formatted to the current locale when displayed in the report.<br />

Note that datasets have a similar `"formulas"` section which can create constants from self-referencing formulas.
