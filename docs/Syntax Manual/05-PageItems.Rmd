# Basic Page Items

## All Items {#item-properties .unnumbered}

Properties common to all items:

- `"id"`: a (unique) numeric identifier for the item. This can be referenced by other items in the report.<br />
     An example can be adding an ID to a graph and then inserting a [common-axis](#common-axis-properties) to the
     report that accepts this ID.
- `"canvas-margins"`: a numeric array (one to four numbers), representing the item's canvas margin going clockwise,
     starting at 12 o'clock.
- `"padding"`: a numeric array (one to four numbers), representing the item's padding going clockwise,
     starting at 12 o'clock.
- `"pen"`: the item's pen, which includes [pen](#pen-properties) properties.
- `"outline"`: a boolean array, specifying the item's border outlines to draw going clockwise,
     starting at 12 o'clock. Note that `"pen"` must be valid and that this is not supported by all objects.
- `"scaling"` numeric value of how much to scale the object's size. For example, `2.0` will be double the
     default size.
- `"show"` boolean value specifying whether to show the item.
- `"anchoring"` controls the starting point of where the object is drawn.<br />
  This is usually only relative for objects being embedded on a plot (e.g., annotations).<br />
  Available options are:
  - `"bottom-left-corner"`
  - `"bottom-right-corner"`
  - `"center"` (the default)
  - `"top-left-corner"`
  - `"top-right-corner"`
- `"relative-alignment"` how an object is aligned with its parent (e.g., an axis title relative to its axis).<br />
  Available options are:
  - `"flush-left"`
  - `"flush-right"`
  - `"flush-top"`
  - `"flush-bottom"`
  - `"centered"`
- `"horizontal-page-alignment"` how to horizontally align the item within its area.<br />
  Available options are:
  - `"left-aligned"`
  - `"right-aligned"`
  - `"centered"`
- `"vertical-page-alignment"` how to vertically align the item within its area.<br />
  Available options are:
  - `"top-aligned"`
  - `"bottom-aligned"`
  - `"centered"`
- `"fit-row-to-content"`: a boolean value specifying whether the item's calculated height should
     control how tall its canvas row is.
- `"fixed-width"`: a boolean value specifying whether the item should be constrained
     to its calculated width within its row.

## Common Axis {#common-axis-properties .unnumbered}

Properties for `"common-axis"` nodes:

- All properties available to [axis](#axis-properties) nodes are included.<br />
  Note that `"axis-type"` will specify where to place the common axis.
- `"child-ids"`: a numeric array of IDs of the graphs that this common axis will manage.<br />
     IDs are assigned to graphs using the `"id"` property, which should be numeric.
- `"common-perpendicular-axis"` if `"axis-type"` is `"bottom-x"`: and this is `true`,
     then the min and max of the graphs' left X axes will be used for the ranges of all the graphs.

## Fillable Shape {#fillable-shape-properties .unnumbered}

Properties for `"fillable-shape"` nodes:

- `"icon"`: a string specifying the icon to draw the shape as.
- `"pen"`: the pen to draw with, which includes [pen](#pen-properties) properties.
- `"brush"`: the brush to paint with, which includes [brush](#brush-properties) properties.
- `"size"`: the size of the shape, which contains the following properties:
  - `"width"`: the width.
  - `"height"`: the height.
- `"fill-percent"`: the percent to fill the shape, which is a number between `0.0` and `1.0`.<br />
  This can either be a numeric or a formula reference.

## Image {#image-properties .unnumbered}

Properties for `"image"` nodes:

- `"image-import"`: an image import specification. (See [image file properties](#image-file-properties).)
- `"resize-method"`: How the image's size is adjusted when its boudning box is changed.<br />
  Available options are:
  - `"downscale-only"`
  - `"downscale-or-upscale"`
  - `"upscale-only"`
  - `"no-resize"`

## Label {#label-properties .unnumbered}

Properties for `"label"` nodes:

- `"text"`: the title's text.<br />
  Note that this property supports embedded formulas that can reference user-defined values loaded from the
  [constants](#constants-properties) section.
- `"orientation"` string specifying the orientation of the text.<br />
  Available options are:
  - `"vertical"`
  - `"horizontal"`
- `"background"`: the background color. This can be either a color name or hex-encoded value.
- `"color"`: the font color. This can be either a color name or hex-encoded value.
- `"bold"`: `true` to make the text bold.
- `"line-spacing"`: a number representing the spaces between lines (if text is multiline).
- `"text-alignment"`: how to align the label's text.<br />
  The available options are:
  - `"flush-left"` or `"ragged-right"`
  - `"flush-right"` or `"ragged-left"`
  - `"centered"`
  - `"justified"` or `"justified-at-character"`
  - `"justified-at-word"`
- `"left-image"`: properties specifying an image to display on the left side of the label.<br />
  The available options are:
  - `"image-import"`: an image import specification. (See [image file properties](#image-file-properties).)
- `"top-image"`: properties specifying an image to display above the label.
  The available options are:
  - `"image-import"`: an image import specification. (See [image file properties](#image-file-properties).)
  - `"offset"`: number specifying how far from the top of the label's box to draw the image. (Default is `0`.)
- `"header"`: attributes to apply to the first row of the label.<br />
     The following sub-properties are available:
  - `"bold"`: `true` to make the header bold.
  - `"color"`: the font color for the header. This can be either a color name or hex-encoded value.
  - `"relative-scaling:"` numeric value of how much to scale the header's font size relative to the label's scaling.
       For example, `2.0` will double the header's default font size compared to the rest of the label.<br />
       Note that this will only affect the header scaling. To alter the label's scaling, use the label's root-level
       `"scaling"` property.

Note that it is recommended to set `"fit-row-to-content"` to `true` if the label is a separate
object on the canvas (i.e., not a label on another object).

## Shape {#shape-properties .unnumbered}

Properties for `"shape"` nodes:

- `"icon"`: a string specifying the icon to draw the shape as.
- `"pen"`: the pen to draw with, which includes [pen](#pen-properties) properties.
- `"brush"`: the brush to paint with, which includes [brush](#brush-properties) properties.
- `"size"`: the size of the shape, which contains the following properties:
  - `"width"`: the width.
  - `"height"`: the height.
