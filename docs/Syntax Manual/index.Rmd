# Overview

A report can be loaded directly from a JSON project file using the `ReportBuilder` class.
These reports can consist of a single page (i.e., a canvas), or a series of multiple pages.
On each page, items such as tables, plots, notes, etc. are embedded, and the project file
specifies how these items are laid out.

Along with the objects on the pages, a project file can also define the datasets and
user-defined values used by report's objects, printer settings, etc.

The following details the available options for JSON project files.
