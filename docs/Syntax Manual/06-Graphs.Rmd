     various separators in them (e.g., parentheses, commas, conjunctions).

  using a dataset.<br />

  - `"simplify"`: a boolean value indicating whether to simplify the bracket's labels.
 
  If building brackets from a dataset, use the following properties:
  - `"dataset"`: the name of the dataset to read the columns from.<br />
       Note that this dataset can be different from the dataset used for the first
       child graph if you are wanting to use different labels. For this situation, the
       `"value"` variable should have the same scale as the child graph.

Properties for row or column table positions:

- `"origin"`: this is either the zero-based index of the row/column, or a string.<br />
     The string values available are `"last-row"` or `"last-column"`,
     which will be interpreted as the last row or column in the data, respectively.<br />
     Column names from the dataset can also be used if looking for a column position.
- `"offset"`: a numeric value combined with the value for `"origin"`.<br />
     This is optional and is useful for when `"origin"` is interpreted at runtime.<br />
     For example, if `origin` is `"last-row"`: and `"offset"` is `-1`, then this will
     result in the second-to-last row.

A position can also be a number or string (e.g., `"last-row"`) if not needing to use the `"origin"`/`"offset"` features.

any bar sorting that you specified will be in effect. Likewise, axis brackets are also added after the bars are sorted;
if specifying start and end points for your brackets, be aware that the bars will already be sorted.
