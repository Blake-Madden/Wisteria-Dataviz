Features
=============================

Wisteria Dataviz contains features such as:

- Numerous built-in graphs (refer to the `Wisteria::Graphs` namespace for a full list)
- Interface for displaying tabular data, including support for aggregate columns/rows, cell highlighting,
  outlier detection, and annotations
- Built-in [printing](Printing.md) support
- Built-in copy support
- [Exporting](Exporting.md) (SVG, PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TGA, TIFF, and WebP are supported)
- Mouse- and keyboard-enabled zooming
- Data [importing](ImportingData.md) (Excel, CSV, tab-delimited, or user-defined delimited files) support
- Data [transformations](TransformingData.md), such as filtering, pivoting (both longer or wider), subsetting, and recoding
- Data exporting (CSV, tab-delimited, or user-defined delimited files) support
- A dataset interface, which allows for easily connecting data to most graphs
  - Includes support for continuous, categorical, date/time, and ID columns
  - Graphs are designed to handle missing data
- Uses high-quality `wxGraphicsContext` for rendering (also uses Direct2D on Windows, if available)
- [Image](Images.md) support, including the ability to use images for plot and bar backgrounds, logos, and point markers
- Image effects, such as:
  - Applying an oil-painting look
  - Applying a Sepia tone
  - Applying a frosted-glass look
  - Creating a silhouette from an image
  - Stitching images together (either vertically or horizontally)
- Effects for boxes and bars, including transparency, a watercolor look, a glassy look, stipple brushes, and color fades
- HiDPI display support (Windows)
- Customizable point markers and line styles
  - Pre-defined and extensible shape schemes
- Customizable [axes](Axes.md)
  - Ranges can be adjusted
  - Supports date ranges
  - Supports logarithmic scales
  - Labels can be stacked, hidden, replaced with custom text, etc.
  - Header and footers can be added
  - Tickmarks can be customized
  - Axis lines can be drawn as a regular line or an arrow
- Custom axes can be added onto the plot area (inside of the main axes)
- Reference lines
- Reference areas (e.g., recession areas on a financial chart)
- Legends with shape, image, and color scale support
- Extensive list of pre-built colors that can be referenced via an enumeration (`Wisteria::Colors::Color`)
- A [color brewing](Colors.md) interface, which is helpful for:
  - Building color scales
  - Shading or tinting colors
  - Selecting black or white (e.g., for a font color), depending on which better contrasts against the background color
- Pre-defined and extensible color schemes
- Multi-plot support
  - Graphs can be embedded side-by-side on the same (scrollable) canvas
  - Includes support for setting a common axis for all graphs across a row or down a column
  - The size proportions of the rows and columns within the canvas can be customized
- Annotations support; story-telling notes can be added to a plot with an arrow pointing to specific data points
- Text boxes that can be drawn vertically or horizontally
- Selectable objects; for example, selecting a bar on a bar chart can show a custom label
- i18n support
  - Fully Unicode
  - Locale-sensitive number formatting (based on `wxUILocale`'s settings)
  - All UI-facing text is available for translation (via the `gettext` library)
- An extensible framework for designing custom graphs
  - New graph types can be designed from the ground up or be derived from existing graph types (e.g., [BarChart](BarChart.md))
  - Uses an object-based API for positioning points, text boxes, polygons, lines, and images
  - Supports custom axes
  - Draw bounding boxes and extended information in debug mode
  - Profiling macros (e.g., `PROFILE()`) to help with reviewing performance
  - i18n functions to help prevent accidental translations (e.g., `DONTTRANSLATE()` and `_DT()`)
  - `LogFile` class for routing logging information to a formatted file
